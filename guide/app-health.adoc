== Monitoring Application Health 

_15 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab we will learn how to monitor application health using OpenShift 
health probes and how you can see container resource consumption using metrics.

.OpenShift Health Probes
--

When building microservices, monitoring becomes of extreme importance to make sure all services 
are running at all times, and when they don't there are automatic actions triggered to rectify 
the issues. 

OpenShift, using Kubernetes health probes, offers a solution for monitoring application 
health and trying to automatically heal faulty containers through restarting them to fix issues such as
a deadlock in the application which can be resolved by restarting the container. Restarting a container 
in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.

Furthermore, there are of course a category of issues that can't be resolved by restarting the container. 
In those scenarios, OpenShift would remove the faulty container from the built-in load-balancer and send traffic 
only to the healthy containers that remain.

There are two types of health probes available in OpenShift: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/welcome/index.html[liveness probes and readiness probes^]. 

* **Liveness probes** are to know when to restart a container
* **Readiness probes** to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.

Health probes also provide crucial benefits when automating deployments with practices like rolling updates in 
order to remove downtime during deployments. A readiness health probe would signal OpenShift when to switch 
traffic from the old version of the container to the new version so that the users don't get affected during 
deployments.

There are https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/welcome/index.html[three ways to define a health probe^] for a container:

* **HTTP Checks:** healthiness of the container is determined based on the response code of an HTTP 
endpoint. Anything between 200 and 399 is considered success. A HTTP check is ideal for applications 
that return HTTP status codes when completely initialized.

* **Container Execution Checks:** a specified command is executed inside the container and the healthiness is 
determined based on the return value (0 is success). 

* **TCP Socket Checks:** a socket is opened on a specified port to the container and it's considered healthy 
only if the check can establish a connection. TCP socket check is ideal for applications that do not 
start listening until initialization is complete.

===  Monitoring Catalog Service Health

http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready[Spring Boot Actuator^] is a 
sub-project of Spring Boot which adds health and management HTTP endpoints to the application. Enabling Spring Boot 
Actuator is done via adding **org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator** dependency to the Maven project 
dependencies which is already done for the **Catalog Service**.

Verify that the health endpoint works for the **Catalog Service** using `*curl*`.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], open a new Terminal by `*clicking 
on the 'My Workspace' white box in the right menu, then 'Plugins' -> 'workshop-tools' -> '>_ New terminal'*`:

image:{% image_path che-open-workshop-terminal.png %}[Che - Open OpenShift Terminal, 700]

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ curl -w "\n" http://catalog-coolstore.{{DEV_PROJECT}}.svc:8080/actuator/health
----

You should have the following output:

[source,json]
----
{"status":"UP"}
----

Like mentioned, health probes are defined on a deployment config for each pod. Add liveness and readiness probes can be done at the same time 
if you want to define the same health endpoint and parameters for both liveness and readiness probes.

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ oc set probe dc/catalog-coolstore \
    --liveness \# <1>
    --readiness \# <2>
    --initial-delay-seconds=30 \# <3>
    --failure-threshold=3 \# <4>
    --get-url=http://:8080/actuator/health \# <5>
    --namespace={{DEV_PROJECT}}
----
<1> **--liveness** is the option to setup a liveness probe to verify this container is running
<2> **--readiness** is the option to setup a readiness probe to indicate when this container should receive traffic
<3> **--initial-delay-seconds** is the option to specify how long 
to wait after the container starts and before to begin checking the probes
<4> **--failure-threshold** is the number of failures before the probe is considered to have failed
<5> **--get-url** defines the HTTP endpoint to use for check the liveness of the container. The ***http://:8080*** 
syntax is a convenient way to define the endpoint without having to worry about the hostname for the running 
container. 

[NOTE]
.Deployment Triggers
====
OpenShift automates deployments using 
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/welcome/index.html[deployment triggers^] 
that react to changes to the container image or configuration. 
Therefore, as soon as you define the probe, OpenShift automatically redeploys the pod using the new configuration including the liveness probe. 
====

[TIP]
====
It's recommended to have separate endpoints for readiness and liveness to indicate to OpenShift when 
to restart the container and when to leave it alone and remove it from the load-balancer so that an administrator 
would  manually investigate the issue. 
====

Voil√†! OpenShift automatically restarts the Catalog pod and as soon as the 
health probes succeed, it is ready to receive traffic.

===  Monitoring Inventory Service Health

https://quarkus.io/guides/health-guide[SmallRye Health^] is a Quarkus extension which utilizes the MicroProfile Health specification.
It allows applications to provide information about their state to external viewers which is typically useful 
in cloud environments where automated processes must be able to determine whether the application should be discarded or restarted.

Let's add the needed dependencies to **/projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus/pom.xml**. 
In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], `*edit the '/projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus/pom.xml' file*`:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-health</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

`*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'Inventory - Build'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-inventory-build.png %}[Che - Inventory Build, 500]

Then, `*push the updated component to the OpenShift cluster*`.

image:{% image_path che-openshift-push-again-inventory.png %}[Che - OpenShift Push Inventory, 400]

Once completed, verify that the health endpoint works for the **Inventory Service** using `*curl*`

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ curl -w "\n" http://inventory-coolstore.{{DEV_PROJECT}}.svc:8080/health
----

You should have the following output:

[source,json]
----
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "Database connection(s) health check",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}
----

Finally, `*Add the Liveness and Readiness Probes*` to the Service

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
oc rollout pause dc/inventory-coolstore --namespace={{DEV_PROJECT}}
oc set probe dc/inventory-coolstore --readiness --initial-delay-seconds=10 --failure-threshold=3 --get-url=http://:8080/health/ready --namespace={{DEV_PROJECT}}
oc set probe dc/inventory-coolstore --liveness --initial-delay-seconds=180 --failure-threshold=3 --get-url=http://:8080/health/live --namespace={{DEV_PROJECT}}
oc rollout resume dc/inventory-coolstore --namespace={{DEV_PROJECT}}
----

OpenShift automatically restarts the Inventory pod and as soon as the health probes succeed, it is ready to receive traffic.

===  Monitoring API Gateway Health

Expectedly, Eclipse Vert.x also provides a http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-health-check/java[health check module^] 
which is enabled by adding **io.vertx:vertx-health-check** as a dependency to the Maven project. 

Verify that the health endpoint works for the **Gateway Service** using `*curl*`

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ curl -w "\n" http://gateway-coolstore.{{DEV_PROJECT}}.svc:8080/health
----

You should have the following output:

[source,json]
----
{"status":"UP"}
----

You are an expert in health probes by now! `*Add Liveness and Readiness Probes*` to the Gateway Service 
using the following information:


.Health Probes
[%header,cols=4*]
|===
|Probe 
|Path
|Initial Delay
|Failure Threshold

|Readiness
|/health
|30
|3

|Liveness
|/health
|30
|3

|===

'''

===  Monitoring Web UI Health

Finally, let's confirm your expertise! `*Add Liveness and Readiness Probes*` to the WebUI Service 
using the following information:


.Health Probes
[%header,cols=4*]
|===
|Probe 
|Path
|Initial Delay
|Timeout

|Readiness
|/
|10
|1

|Liveness
|/
|180
|1

|===

[TIP]
.Timeout Parameter
====
Use the **--timeout-seconds** parameter for **oc probe** command.
It defines the time in seconds to wait before considering the probe to have failed.
====

'''

=== Monitoring Metrics

Metrics are another important aspect of monitoring applications which is required in order to 
gain visibility into how the application behaves and particularly in identifying issues.

OpenShift provides container metrics out-of-the-box and displays how much memory, cpu and network 
each container has been consuming over time. 

In the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Advanced' -> 'Projects' then select your '{{DEV_PROJECT}}' project*`.

In the project overview, you can see the **Health** and **Resource Usage** sections

image:{% image_path health-metrics-brief.png %}[Container Metrics,740]

From the **Developer view**, `*select any Deployment Config (DC) and click on the associated Pod (P)*`

In the pod overview, you can see a more detailed view of the pod consumption.

image:{% image_path health-metrics-detailed.png %}[Container Metrics,900]

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
