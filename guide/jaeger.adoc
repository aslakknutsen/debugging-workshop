_20 MINUTES PRACTICE_

As Cobb and Arthur in *Inception*, let's perform a *"Trace Within a Trace" Strategy* called **Distributed Tracing** using Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to infiltrate the application traces and extract valuable information to solve the issues

https://www.jaegertracing.io[Jaeger Tracing^], inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin, is a distributed tracing system released as open source by Uber Technologies. It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems, including:

* Distributed context propagation
* Distributed transaction monitoring
* Root cause analysis
* Service dependency analysis
* Performance / latency optimization

https://www.kiali.io[Kiali^] includes https://www.jaegertracing.io[Jaeger Tracing^] to provide distributed tracing out of the box.

=== What are you hidding, Mr/Mrs *Application*?

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because of certificates issues, you need first to access the main {{ JAEGER_URL }}[Jaeger Console^] to use it through Kiali.
====

From the {{ KIALI_URL }}[Kiali Console^], `*click on the 'Distributed Tracing'*` in the left navigation and enter the following configuration:

 * Select a Namespace: **{{ PROJECT }}**
 * Select a Service: **gateway**
 * Then click on the **'Search Traces' button** on the right

image:{% image_path jaeger-query.png %}[Jaeger - Query, 800]

By default, **Service Mesh** automatically sends collected tracing data to Jaeger, so that we are able to **only see individual trace** (one-to-one service call).

* 1 individual trace for **Gateway Service** -> **Catalog Service**
* 7 individual traces for **Gateway Service** -> **Inventory Service**

image:{% image_path jaeger-trace-2spans-view.png %}[Jaeger - Traces View, 800]

As you have called several times the **Gateway Service** through the Web UI, you find much more than 8 spans in Jaeger and you cannot easily observe the entire trace for an end-to-end request.

'''

=== Enabling Distributed Context Propagation

**Distributed Tracing** involves propagating the tracing context from service to service by sending certain incoming HTTP headers downstream to outbound requests. To do this, services need some hints to tie together the entire trace. They need to propagate the appropriate HTTP headers so that when the proxies send span information, the spans can be correlated correctly into a single trace.

Let's enable Distributed Context Propagation from the **Gateway Service**.

First, you are going to intercept the following header creating by **Service Mesh** in order to add them into the outbound requests:

 * x-request-id
 * x-b3-traceid
 * x-b3-spanid
 * x-b3-parentspanid
 * x-b3-sampled
 * x-b3-flags
 * x-ot-span-context

In Che7, under the **src/main/java** directory of the **gateway-vertx** project,
`*create a new 'TracingInterceptor' class*` in the **com.redhat.cloudnative.gateway** package as following:

[source,java]
.TracingInterceptor.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.gateway;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.function.Function;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import io.vertx.core.Handler;
import io.vertx.ext.web.client.impl.WebClientInternal;
import io.vertx.rxjava.ext.web.RoutingContext;
import io.vertx.rxjava.ext.web.client.WebClient;

public class TracingInterceptor {
    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(TracingInterceptor.class);
    
    private static final List<String> FORWARDED_HEADER_NAMES = Arrays.asList(
        "x-request-id",
        "x-b3-traceid",
        "x-b3-spanid",
        "x-b3-parentspanid",
        "x-b3-sampled",
        "x-b3-flags",
        "x-ot-span-context"
    );

    private static final String X_TRACING_HEADERS = "X-Tracing-Headers";

    private TracingInterceptor() {
        // Avoid direct instantiation.
    }

    static Handler<RoutingContext> create() {
        return rc -> {
            Set<String> names = rc.request().headers().names();
            Map<String, List<String>> headers = names.stream()
                .map(String::toLowerCase)
                .filter(FORWARDED_HEADER_NAMES::contains)
                .collect(Collectors.toMap(
                    Function.identity(),
                    h -> Collections.singletonList(rc.request().getHeader(h))
                ));
            rc.put(X_TRACING_HEADERS, headers);
            rc.next();
        };
    }
    
    static WebClient propagate(WebClient client, RoutingContext rc) {
        WebClientInternal delegate = (WebClientInternal) client.getDelegate();
        delegate.addInterceptor(ctx -> {
            Map<String, List<String>> headers = rc.get(X_TRACING_HEADERS);
            if (headers != null) {
                LOG.info("Propagating header: {}", headers);
                headers.forEach((s, l) -> l.forEach(v -> ctx.request().putHeader(s, v)));
            }
            ctx.next();
        });
        return client;
    }
}
----

Then, route all traffic into the **TracingInterceptor** handler `*by uncommenting the 'TraceInterceptor handler' configuration in the 'start()' method of the 'GatewayVerticle' class*` with the following code:

[source,java]
.GatewayVerticle.java
----
        // Enable TraceInterceptor handler
        router.route()
            .order(-1)
            .handler(TracingInterceptor.create());
----

Finally, propagate the headers from the incoming request **Gateway Service** to any outgoing requests **Catalog Service** and **Inventory Service** using the **propagate()** method from **TracingInterceptor** class when calling outgoing services in the **products()** method.

[subs="source,java,quotes"]
.GatewayVerticle.java
----
        private void products(RoutingContext rc) {
            [...]
            [.line-through]#catalog.get("/api/catalog")#
            TracingInterceptor.propagate(catalog, rc).get("/api/catalog")
            [...]
            [.line-through]#inventory.get("/api/inventory/" + product.getString("itemId"))#
            TracingInterceptor.propagate(inventory, rc).get("/api/inventory/" + product.getString("itemId"))
            [...]
        }
----

Now push the new version of the source code to OpenShift.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Task: Run Task...' ->  'che: oc build gateway service'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-buildgateway.png %}[Che - Build Gateway Service, 500]

`*Go back to Distributed Tracing menu`* from {{ KIALI_URL }}[Kiali Console^] and see the result.
Now you have the aggregated traces and it is much more better.

image:{% image_path jaeger-trace-delay-view.png %}[Jaeger - Trace Delay View, 700]

On the left hand side, you have information like the duration.
One request takes **more than 400ms** which you could judge as *normal* but ...

`*Let’s click on a trace title bar.*`

image:{% image_path jaeger-trace-delay-detail-view.png %}[Jaeger - Trace Delay Detail View, 700]

Interesting... The major part of a call is consuming by the **Catalog Service**.
So let's have a look on its code. 
`*Go through the 'catalog-spring-boot' project and find the following piece of code*`:

[source,java]
.CatalogController.java
----
@ResponseBody
@GetMapping(produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public List<Product> getAll() {
    Spliterator<Product> products = repository.findAll().spliterator();
    Random random = new Random();

    List<Product> result = new ArrayList<Product>();
    products.forEachRemaining(product -> {
        Class<Product> clazz = Product.class;
        if (clazz.isInstance(product)){
            try {
                Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(10) * 10);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        result.add(product);
    });
    return result;
}
----

And yes, this burns your eyes, right?! Basically nobody could understand what the developer attempted to achieve but we do not have the time for that.
This piece of code is a part of the **getAll()** method which returns the list of all products from the database. 
As you are an expert of Java 8, you are about to create a masterpiece by both simplifying the code and increasing performance. 

`*Replace the content of the 'getAll()' method*` as following:

[source,java]
.CatalogController.java
----
    @ResponseBody
    @GetMapping(produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    public List<Product> getAll() {
        Spliterator<Product> products = repository.findAll().spliterator();
        return StreamSupport.stream(products, false).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not forget to import the missing packages.
====

Now let's check and push the new version of the source code.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Task: Run Task...' ->  'che: oc build catalog service'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-buildcatalog.png %}[Che - Build Catalog Service, 500]

Once deployed, generate traffic to the application (http://{{ PROJECT }}.{{ APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX }}[http://{{ PROJECT }}.{{ APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX }}^]) 
then `*go back to Distributed Tracing menu`* from {{ KIALI_URL }}[Kiali Console^] and see the result.

image:{% image_path jaeger-trace-fixed-detail-view.png %}[Jaeger - Trace Detail View, 700]

Just wonderful! You reduce the response time by a factor of 5!! You should be proud!!

'''

=== CONGRATULATIONS!!!

You make it but **is the spinning top stopped or not at the end?**
