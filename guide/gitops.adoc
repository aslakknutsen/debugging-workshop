== Gitops

_20 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about deploying and managing Kubernetes resources using a GitOps tool.

'''

=== What is Argo CD?

image:{% image_path argocd-logo.png %}[Argo CD Logo, 200]

https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/[Argo CD^] is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

It follows the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining 
the desired application state. 

It automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. Application 
deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit.

=== Export OpenShift Resources

First, you need to export the project resources from OpenShift.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'GitOps - Export'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-gitops-export.png %}[Che - GitOps Export, 500]

A terminal should be opened with the following output:

[source,shell]
.>_ GitOps Export
----
--- Export Kubernetes resources for GitOps from {{DEV_PROJECT}} to {{PROJECT}} ---
Exporting resources for inventory-coolstore...
Exporting resources for catalog-coolstore...
Exporting resources for gateway-coolstore...
Exporting resources for web-coolstore...
--- Kubernetes resources has been exported! ---
----

This operation exports the project resources (deploymentconfig, route, secret, service)
and cleans them up. As a result, you should have all resources in YAML files under 
the **/project/workshop/lab/gitops** folder.

'''

=== Push them into a Git Repository

The first step is to store all Kubernetes/OpenShift resources in 
a source code repository. You can use any Git server (e.g. GitHub, BitBucket, etc) for this lab but we have prepared a 
Gogs git server.

`*Click on the below button called 'Developer Repository'*`

[link={{ GOGS_URL }}]
[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::{% image_path developer-repository-button.png  %}[Developer Repository - Button, 300]

Then, `*click on 'Register'*` to register a new user with the following details:


.Gogs Registration
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value

|Username 
|{{OPENSHIFT_USER}}

|Email
|{{OPENSHIFT_USER}}@none.com

|Password
|{{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}}

| Re-Type
|{{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}}

|===

image:{% image_path cd-gogs-signup.png %}[Sign Up Gogs,700]

`*Click on 'Create New Account'*`. 
You will be redirected to the sign in page. Sign in using the above username and password.

`*Click on the plus icon*` as below

image:{% image_path cd-gogs-plus-icon.png %}[Create New Repository,900]


`*Give 'gitops-cn-project' as Repository Name*`

image:{% image_path gogs-gitops-new-repo.png %}[Create New Repository,700]

`*Click on 'Create Repository' button*`.The Git repository is created now. 

'''

=== Push The Configuration to the Git Repository

Now that you have a Git repository for the Inventory service, you should push the 
source code into this Git repository.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], via the command menu (`*'View' -> 'Find Command...'*`),
`*run 'Git: Initialize Repository'*`

image:{% image_path che-git-init.png %}[Che - Git Initialize, 600]

`*Select the '/projects/workshop/labs/gitops' folder, click on 'Initialize Repository' -> 'Add to Workspace'*`

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], open a new Terminal by `*clicking 
on the 'My Workspace' white box in the right menu, then 'Plugins' -> 'workshop-tools' -> '>_ New terminal'*`:

image:{% image_path che-open-workshop-terminal.png %}[Che - Open OpenShift Terminal, 700]

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
cd /projects/workshop/labs/gitops
git remote add origin http://gogs-gogs-server.workshop-infra.svc:3000/{{OPENSHIFT_USER}}/gitops-cn-project.git
----

Via the command menu (`*'View' -> 'Find Command...'*`),
`*run 'Git: Close Repository'*`

Via the command menu (`*'View' -> 'Find Command...'*`),
`*run 'Git: Open Repository' and select the '/projects/workshop/labs/gitops' folder*`

Open the **Source Code Management (SCM) view** by clicking on `*'View' -> 'SCM menu'*`

`*Click on '...' -> 'Stage All Changes'*`

image:{% image_path che-scm-gitops-stage-all-changes.png %}[Che - SCM Stage All Changes, 500]

`*Click on the 'check' icon and enter 'Initial' as commit message*`

image:{% image_path che-scm-commit.png %}[Che - SCM Commit, 900]

`*Click on '...' -> 'Push'*`

image:{% image_path che-scm-push.png %}[Che - SCM Push, 500]

`*Click on the 'OK' button*` to publish the new **master branch**. 
Finally, `*enter your Gogs credentials ({{OPENSHIFT_USER}}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }})*`.

image:{% image_path che-scm-username.png %}[Che - SCM Username, 500]

image:{% image_path che-scm-password.png %}[Che - SCM Password, 500]

Once done, in {{ GOGS_URL }}/{{OPENSHIFT_USER}}/gitops-cn-project, `*refresh the page of your 'gitops-cn-project' repository*`. You should 
see the project files in the repository.

'''

=== Configure Argo CD

You are going to to use the Argo CD CLI tool to interact with the Argo CD Server.

First, `*let's login using the current admin user*`.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], open a new Terminal by `*clicking 
on the 'My Workspace' white box in the right menu, then 'Plugins' -> 'workshop-tools' -> '>_ New terminal'*`:

image:{% image_path che-open-workshop-terminal.png %}[Che - Open OpenShift Terminal, 700]

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following command*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ argocd --insecure --grpc-web login argocd-server.argocd.svc:443 --username admin --password {{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}}
----

You should have the following output:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
WARNING: server is not configured with TLS. Proceed (y/n)? y
'admin' logged in successfully
Context 'argocd-server.argocd.svc:443' updated
----

Next, `*you need to add the newly created repository, **'gitops-cn-project'**, to Argo CD*` with the following command:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ argocd repo add http://gogs-gogs-server.workshop-infra.svc:3000/{{OPENSHIFT_USER}}/gitops-cn-project.git
----

As output, you should see:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
repository 'http://gogs-gogs-server.workshop-infra.svc:3000/{{OPENSHIFT_USER}}/gitops-cn-project.git' added
----

Finally, `*let's create the application in Argo CD*`.

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ argocd app create \
    --project default \
    --name {{PROJECT}} \
    --repo http://gogs-gogs-server.workshop-infra.svc:3000/{{OPENSHIFT_USER}}/gitops-cn-project.git \
    --path . \
    --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \
    --dest-namespace {{PROJECT}} \
    --revision master \
    --sync-policy none
----

As output, you should see:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
application '{{PROJECT}}' created
----

Now your **'gitops-cn-project'** repository is synchronized with your **'{{PROJECT}}'** project.

'''

=== Deploy your Application into the Staging Environment

Now you set up your application in Argo CD, `*let's sync it in your {{PROJECT}} project*`.

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ argocd app sync {{PROJECT}}
----

Once done, in the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*Select the '{{PROJECT}}'*` to be taken to the project overview page.

image:{% image_path openshift-app-deployed-by-argocd.png %}[OpenShift - Coolstore Project Deployed by Argo CD , 700]

You can see that all resources of your application have been created by Argo CD. 
None of the services is deployed, up and running as we removed all automatic deployment triggers when exporting the configuration
and there is no image available on your **{{PROJECT}}** project. **You are going to fix it in the next lab.**

'''

Well done! You are ready for the next lab.
