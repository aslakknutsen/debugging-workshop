== Web UI with Node.js and AngularJS 

_10 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about Node.js and will deploy the Node.js and Angular-based 
web frontend for the CoolStore online shop which uses the API Gateway services you deployed 
in previous labs.

=== What is Node.js?

https://nodejs.org/[Node.js^] is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side 
applications using JavaScript. https://nodejs.org/[Node.js^] has an event-driven architecture capable of 
non-blocking I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in 
Web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time web applications.

https://nodejs.org/[Node.js^] non-blocking architecture allows applications to process large number of 
requests (tens of thousands) using a single thread which makes it desirable choice for building 
scalable web applications.

=== Deploy on OpenShift

The Web UI is built using Node.js for server-side JavaScript and AngularJS for client-side 
JavaScript. Let's deploy it on OpenShift using the certified Node.js container image available 
in OpenShift. 

In the previous labs, you used the OpenShift 
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/welcome/index.html[Source-to-Image (S2I)^] 
feature via the https://maven.fabric8.io[Fabric8 Maven Plugin^] to build a container image from the 
source code on your laptop. In this lab, you will still use S2I but instead instruct OpenShift 
to obtain the application code directly from the source repository and build and deploy a 
container image of it.

In the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on '+ Add' and select 'From Git'*`

Then, enter the following information:

=== Update Annotations

For the integration with the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-openshift-connector[OpenShift Connector^] plugin, 
you need to add a specific annotation when deploying a component without use it.

In the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'DC web-coolstore' -> 'Actions' -> 'Edit Annotations'*`

image:{% image_path openshift-web-annotate.png %}[OpenShift - Web Annotate, 700]

`*Add the new annotation*` in order to be compatible with odo usage.

=== Test your Service

In the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on the 'Open URL' icon of the Web Service*`

image:{% image_path openshift-web-topology.png %}[OpenShift - Web Topology, 700]

Your browser will be redirect on **your Web Service running on OpenShift**.
You should be able to see the CoolStore with all products and their inventory status.
