== "Bird Box"... Not Today!!

_15 MINUTES PRACTICE_

The **Mysterious Application** in your *Developer Workspaces* is now up and running. It is composed of several components, but so far, you have no clue about how the application is working.
Going all over this application and debugging it completely blindfolded is time consuming and a crazy bid as Malorie does in *Bird Box*.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides services to get observability of applications and to understand how different components are interacting with each other.

=== What is Kiali?

A Microservice Architecture breaks up the monolith into many smaller pieces that are composed together. Patterns to secure the communication between services like fault tolerance (via timeout, retry, circuit breaking, etc.) have come up as well as distributed tracing to be able to see where calls are going.

A service mesh can now provide these services on a platform level and frees the application writers from those tasks. Routing decisions are done at the mesh level.

https://www.kiali.io[Kiali^] works with Istio, in OpenShift or Kubernetes, to visualize the service mesh topology, to provide visibility into features like circuit breakers, request rates and more. It offers insights about the mesh components at different levels, from abstract Applications to Services and Workloads.

=== "Kiali, please tell me, how is the application working?"

Kiali provides an interactive graph view of your namespace in real time, being able to display the interactions at several levels (applications, versions, workloads), with contextual information and charts on the selected graph node or edge.

First, you need to access to Kiali. 
`*Launch a browser and navigate to {{ KIALI_URL }}[Kiali Console^] and log in as {{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }}*`

After you log in, `*click on 'Graph'`* in the left navigation and enter the following configuration:

 * Namespace: **{{ PROJECT }}**
 * Display: **check 'Traffic Animation'**

image:{% image_path kiali-graph.png %}[Kiali - Graph, 700]

This page shows a graph with all the microservices, connected by the requests going through them. On this page, you can see how the services interact with each other.

Even if the application *seemed* working fine, there is a problem in the *Gateway Service* which sends a *4xx http error*.

image:{% image_path kiali-4xx.png %}[Kiali - 4xx, 300]

[WARNING]
====
In order to get the previous screen, please reload the **Web UI** more than one time!
====

Open the Javascript Console from your browser, and you will find a **404 error** when calling the **'gateway/api/cart'** API.

image:{% image_path gateway-cart-missing.png %}[Gateway Error, 700]

Indeed, when you check the APIs exposed by the **Gateway Service**, you cannot find any **'/api/cart/id-*'** one.

Let's fix it!!

=== Build and deploy the Quarkus microservice, the Cart Service

https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^] is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards.

* Architectured for running in serverless and container environments like Knative and OpenShift. 
* Designed around a **container first philosophy**, what this means in real terms is that Quarkus is optimised for low memory usage and fast startup times.

We already compiled the Cart Service application to a native executable called **cart-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner**. You can find in the **cart-quarkus** project under the **src/target** folder. It improves the startup time of the **Cart Service**, and produces a minimal disk footprint. The executable would have everything to run the application including the "JVM" and the application.

In this chapter, you will focus on creating a Docker image using the produced native executable.

[TIP]
====
If you want, take a moment to examine the source code of the Cart Service implemented with https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^].
You can find it under the package **com.redhat.cloudnative** in the **src/main/java** directory of the **cart-quarkus** project.
====

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], open a new Terminal with OpenShift tools by `*clicking 
on the 'My Workspace' white box in the right menu, then 'Plugins' -> 'vscode-openshift-connector' -> '>_ New terminal'*`:

image:{% image_path che-open-openshift-terminal.png %}[Che - Open OpenShift Terminal, 700]

In the window called **'>_ vscode-openshift-connector terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ vscode-openshift-connector terminal
----
# To build the image on OpenShift
$ oc new-build --binary --name=cart -lapp=cart,version=v1.0
$ oc patch bc/cart -p '{"spec":{"strategy":{"dockerStrategy":{"dockerfilePath":"src/main/docker/Dockerfile"}}}}'
$ oc start-build cart --from-dir /projects/labs/cart-quarkus --follow

# To instantiate the image
$ oc new-app --image-stream=cart:latest -lapp=cart,version=v1.0

# To deploy an Istio SideCar and configure Catalog Service Deployment
$ oc rollout pause dc/cart
$ oc patch dc/cart --patch '{"spec": {"template": {"metadata": {"annotations": {"sidecar.istio.io/inject": "true"}}}}}'
$ oc set env dc/cart CATALOG_ENDPOINT=http://catalog:8080
$ oc rollout resume dc/cart

**YOU HAVE TO SEE THAT!** 
Have a look to the log of the **Cart Service** pod by cliking in the dark blue circle and then **just admire its amazing FAST BOOT TIME!**

[source,shell]
.Cart Service logs
----
2019-04-01 20:13:35,623 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Quarkus 0.11.0 started in 0.009s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080

----

**AND YES, IT'S A JAVA APPLICATION!**

=== Update Gateway Service

Previously, we deployed the **Cart Service**. Now, you have to take it in account in the **Gateway Service**.

Under the **/projects/labs/gateway-vertx** project, `*uncomment the '/api/cart/:cardId' route in the 'start()' method of the 'GatewayVerticle' class*` as following:

[source,java]
.GatewayVerticle.java
----
        // Cart Route
        router.get("/api/cart/:cardId").handler(this::getCartHandler);
----

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Task: Run Task...' ->  'che: oc build gateway service'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-buildgateway.png %}[Che - Build Gateway Service, 500]

Once deployed, check your javascript console that the **404 error** has disappeared.
In Kiali Graph, the **Gateway Service** is now green and you can see the new **Cart Service** is now present!

=== CONGRATULATIONS!!!

You survive and you put off the blindfold on your own. But it is not THE END...

Now, let's go deeper!!
