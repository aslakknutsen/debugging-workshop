== A/B Testing with Service Mesh

_10 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will see how you can use *OpenShift Service Mesh* to do some A/B testing using and route traffic between 2 versions of the Catalog service.

'''

=== Deploy the new Catalog Service

A new **Catalog Service v2** has been implemented in https://golang.org/[Golang^] which uses the same business logic than **Catalog Service v1** 
except that all product descriptions are returned in **UPPERCASE**.


Let's deploy the service. In the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on '+ Add' and select 'From Docker'*`

Then, `*enter the following information and click on 'Create' button*` :

.Catalog v2 Project
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter 
|Value

|Git Repo URL
|{{WORKSHOP_GIT_REPO}}

|Git Reference
|{{WORKSHOP_GIT_REF}}

|Context Dir
|/labs/catalog-go

|Application Name
|coolstore

|Name
|catalog-coolstore-v2

|Create a route to the application
|Checked

|Labels
|app=coolstore app.kubernetes.io/instance=catalog app.kubernetes.io/name=golang app.kubernetes.io/part-of=coolstore version=2.0

|===

Now, `*enable the Service Mesh to the service*` by adding the Istio sidecar to the **Catalog Service v2**.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], open a new Terminal by `*clicking 
on the 'My Workspace' white box in the right menu, then 'Plugins' -> 'workshop-tools' -> '>_ New terminal'*`:

image:{% image_path che-open-workshop-terminal.png %}[Che - Open OpenShift Terminal, 700]

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ oc patch dc/catalog-coolstore-v2 --patch \
  '{"spec": {"template": {"metadata": {"annotations": {"sidecar.istio.io/inject": "true"}}}}}'
----

To confirm that the application is successfully deployed, `*run this following command*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ oc get pods -ldeploymentconfig=catalog-coolstore-v2
NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
catalog-coolstore-v2-3-n2bmf   2/2       Running   0          24s
----

The status should be **Running** and there should be **2/2** pods in the **Ready** column.
Wait few seconds that the application restarts.

=== Enabling A/B Testing

[sidebar]
.A/B Testing
--
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing[A/B testing^] allows running multiple versions of a functionality in parallel and using analytics of the user behavior it is possible to determine which version is the best. 
It is also possible to launch the new features only for a small set of users, to prepare the general avalability of a new feature. 
--

The implementation of such procedure like **A/B Testing** is one are the advantages coming with OpenShift Service Mesh.
For this lab, you want to answer the following question: 

**Do the product descriptions written in uppercase increase sales rate?**

The only step is to define the rules to distribute the traffic between the services. A **VirtualService** defines a set of traffic routing rules 
to apply when a host is addressed. Each routing rule defines matching criteria for traffic of a specific protocol. 
If the traffic is matched, then it is sent to a named destination service (or subset/version of it) defined in the registry.

In the Terminal window, `*issue the following command*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: catalog-coolstore
spec:
  hosts:
    - catalog-coolstore
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: catalog-coolstore
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: catalog-coolstore-v2
      weight: 10
EOF
----
Doing so, you route **90%** of the **HTTP traffic** to pods of the **Catalog Service** and the **10%** remaining to pods of the **Catalog Service v2**.

'''

=== Generate HTTP traffic.

Let's now see the A/B testing with Site Mesh in action.
First, we need to generate HTTP traffic by sending several requests to the **Gateway Service** from the **Istio Gateway**

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'Gateway - Generate Traffic'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-gateway-traffic.png %}[Che - Gateway Traffic, 500]

In the window called **'>_ Gateway - Generate Traffic terminal'**, 
you likely see **'Gateway => Catalog Spring Boot (v1)'** or **'Gateway => Catalog GoLang (v2)'**

image:{% image_path  che-run-gateway-90-10.png %}[Terminal - RunGatewayService,200]

TIP: You can also go to the Web interface and refresh the page to see that product descriptions is sometimes in uppercase (v2) or not (v1).

In {{ KIALI_URL }}[Kiali Console^], from the **'Graph' view**,
`*enter the following parameters*` to see the traffic distribution between Catalog v1 and v2:

.Graph Settings
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value

|Namespace 
|{{PROJECT}}

|Display
|'Traffic Animation' checked

|Display
|'Traffic Animation' checked

|Edge Label
|Requests percentage

|Fetching
|Last 5 min

|===

image:{% image_path kiali-abtesting-90-10.png %}[Kiali- Graph,700]

You can see that the traffic between the two version of the **Catalog** is shared as defined (at least very very close). 

=== Validate the result

After one week trial, you have collected enough information to confirm that product descriptions in uppercase do increate sales rates. 
So you will route all the traffic to **Catalog Service v2**.

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ cat << EOF | oc replace -f -
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: catalog-coolstore
spec:
  hosts:
    - catalog-coolstore
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: catalog-coolstore
      weight: 0
    - destination:
        host: catalog-coolstore-v2
      weight: 100
EOF
----

Now, you likely see only *'Gateway => Catalog GoLang (v2)'* in the **'>_ Gateway - Generate Traffic terminal'**.

image:{% image_path  che-run-gateway-100-0.png %}[Terminal - RunGatewayService,200]

And from {{ KIALI_URL }}[Kiali Console^], you can visualize that **100%** of the traffic is switching gradually to **Catalog Service v2**.

That's all for this lab! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
