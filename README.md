# Debugging microservices applications on Red Hat OpenShift 
[![Contribute](images/factory-contribute.svg)](http://codeready-workspaces.apps.cluster-5ed3.5ed3.events.opentlc.com/f?name=debugging-microservices&user=admin)

## Purpose

As microservices-based applications become more prevalent, both the number of
and complexity of their interactions increases. Up until now much of the burden
of managing these complex microservices interactions has been placed on the
application developer, with different or non-existent support for microservice
concepts depending on language and framework.

Deploying and managing microservices architecture is becoming easier with a 
container orchestration platform like Openshift. So now, critical questions
 is raising: How do you debug a distributed system and how do you ensure 
the good health of your application? Debugging microservices architecture is hard. 
The state of the application is spread through multiple microservices which makes 
more complicated to get a global overview for debugging purposes.

## Background
This hands-on workshop will introduce and help you to get familiar with the common 
tracing/debugging techniques using Jaeger/OpenTracing, Istio, Kiali and Squash in 
a microservice context

# Agenda
* Kiali / Istio
* Opentracing - Jaeger
* Realtime Debugging with Squash
